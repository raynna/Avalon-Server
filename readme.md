## Getting Started

Place the contents of the cache zip into the /data/cache/ directory.

[Cache](https://mega.nz/file/kFBwwKwb#GxIZ5dwHzsvW7_6ApFD7HG0xx0TTD0ROCOoymbecPuc)
[Client](https://github.com/raynna/avalon-client)
Run the server using `Launcher.java` or by running the jar from the command line using

`java -jar Client.jar`

Please note when launching via Jar, you will need to place the /data/ directory where the Jar file is located. Please see the attached screenshot. You can get this folder by downloading the repo as a zip.

The server may throw an error for /data/cache/ not being present. Make sure this is added!

Requires JDK 21.
