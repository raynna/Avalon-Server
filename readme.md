# Avalon Server

A RuneScape private server framework, based on client build 718, loading a 727 cache. Using a Matrix codebase.

## Getting Started

Place the contents of the cache zip into the /data/cache/ directory.

[Cache Link - Mega](https://mega.nz/file/kFBwwKwb#GxIZ5dwHzsvW7_6ApFD7HG0xx0TTD0ROCOoymbecPuc)

Run the server using `Launcher.java` or by running the jar from the command line using

`java -jar Avalon.jar`

Please note when launching via Jar, you will need to place the /data/ directory where the Jar file is located. Please see the attached screenshot. You can get this folder by downloading the repo as a zip.

The server may throw an error for /data/cache/ not being present. Make sure this is added!

Requires JDK 8.
